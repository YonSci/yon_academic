- [Tutorials](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-7/) on data analysis & visualization methods mainly using `Python` & `R` programming languages (with some practical examples).
- Links to different [scientific datasets](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//datasets/)
- [Lecture notes](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//teaching/) 
- Some [blogs](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//year-archive/) to share the recent knowledge & whatever comes to my mind ðŸ˜Ž ...
       
  in the fields of `meteorology`, `hydrology`, `climate`, `remote sensing`, and `geographic information systems (GIS)`. 
  
  My goal is to share `well documented` and `reproducible` scientific data analysis approaches based on `open source` philosophy.
