This page provides: 

   - _computer model workflows and installation procedures_
   - _links to different scientific datasets and papers_ 
   - _data analysis and interpretation methods_ 
  
  in the fields of meteorology, hydrology, climate, remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS). 
  
  My goal is to share `well documented` and `reproducible` scientific data analysis approaches based on `open source` philosophy.
