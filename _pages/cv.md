General Information 
======

Hi there, I am a Ph.D. student at the Ethiopian Institute of Water Resources (EIWR), Addis Ababa University (AAU), where my research focuses on understanding `land surface driven processes` and `land-atmosphere feedbacks` through the use of `Earth System Models`, specifically the `Community Land Model (CLM)` and `Regional Climate Model (RegCM)`. I'm also investigating the characteristics of `extreme hydro-climate events`  and their relationships with `large-scale ocean-atmosphere oscillations` like ENSO, IOD, MJO, and NAO over Ethiopia.
