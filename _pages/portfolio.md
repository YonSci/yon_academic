<div align="justify"> It is widely acknowledged that configuring, installing, & running models on Linux-based platforms has more benefits for computational disciplines. Recently, Windows 10 has provided a <b> <em>lightweight Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL)</em> </b> tool that allows users to run various Linux distros such as Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and Mint on Windows-10. The WSL does not require any virtualization and much memory that makes it super useful. As a result, this tool enables users to explore the benefits of Linux distros alongside Windows without losing Windows OS. In this contest, the following <a href="https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-1/" target="_top">steps</a> can be used to install WSL on Windows. </div>

<div align="justify"> Anaconda is an open-source distribution for programming languages such as <b> <em>Python</em> </b> and <b> <em>R</em> </b>. It provides cross-platform package manager, python packages/libraries, & IDE/editors. It is mainly used for data science & scientific computing applications. It can be used with either the <b> <em> conda command-line </em> </b>  tool or the <b> <em> Anaconda Navigator</em> </b> desktop GUI. The primary benefit of Anaconda for our field is that it enables us to easily install and run various computing software packages & all dependencies in separate environments, preventing package conflict. This <a href="https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-2/" target="_top">tutorial</a> will walk you through the installation of Anaconda on an Ubuntu system. If you are using Windows & do not have Ubuntu installed, this <a href="https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-1/" target="_top">link</a> will take you to the Ubuntu installation steps on Windows-10.
