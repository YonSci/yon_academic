## [Anaconda Installation](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-2/)

<div align="justify"> Anaconda is an open-source distribution for programming languages such as <b> <em>Python</em> </b> and <b> <em>R</em> </b>. It provides cross-platform package manager, python packages/libraries, & IDE/editors. It is mainly used for data science & scientific computing applications. It can be used with either the <b> <em> conda command-line </em> </b>  tool or the <b> <em> Anaconda Navigator</em> </b> desktop GUI. The primary benefit of Anaconda for our field is that it enables us to easily install and run various computing software packages & all dependencies in separate environments, preventing package conflict. This <a href="https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-2/" target="_top">tutorial</a> will walk you through the installation of Anaconda on an Ubuntu system. If you are using Windows & do not have Ubuntu installed, this <a href="https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-1/" target="_top">link</a> will take you to the Ubuntu installation steps on Windows-10. If you're using an Ubuntu system, you're good to go ðŸ˜Ž </div>

## [Installation of various climate data processing tools](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-3/)

This tutorial includes [CDO](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-3/), [NCO](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-3/), & [NCL](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-3/) installation steps with conda package manager. You need to become familiar with these tools if you want to process, manipulate, and generate high-quality plots from climate and weather data.
