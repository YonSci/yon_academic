This tutorial includes [CDO](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-3/), [NCO](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-3/), & [NCL](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-3/) installation steps with conda package manager. You need to become familiar with these tools if you want to process, manipulate, and generate high-quality plots from climate and weather data. If you have not previously installed Anaconda on your system, you can do so by following the previous [tutorial](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-2/).


                                                               
## Setting up NCO
`NCO (NetCDF Operators)` is a set of open source command-line tools for analyzing, processing, viewing, & manipulating netCDF files. It was developed by atmospheric scientists at UC-Irvine.

This tutorial includes `NCO` installation steps with `conda package manager`. If you have not previously installed Anaconda on your system, you can do so by following the previous [tutorial](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-2/).

To install NCO, launch ubuntu terminal and type the following commands:  

First create NCO environment:
<textarea style="border: none;background-color:orange;">
conda create --name nco_stable	
</textarea>  
Choose y when prompted

Once the environment is created, activate it by typing:  
<textarea style="border: none;background-color:orange;">
source activate nco_stable
</textarea>

Install the NCO package:
<textarea style="border: none;background-color:orange;">
conda install -c conda-forge nco
</textarea>

To update NCO environment to its latest version:
<textarea style="border: none;background-color:orange;">
conda update --all  
</textarea>
Choose y to approve of the udpates

You have now successfully installed NCO. To exit from `nco_stable` environment, simply type:  
<textarea style="border: none;background-color:orange;">
conda deactivate
</textarea>

## Setting up NCAR Command Language(NCL)

NCL is an interpreted language developed by [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) for the analysis &  visualization of climate & weather data. It supports importing and exporting files in a variety of formats, including NetCDF, GRIB, HDF, HDF-EOS, & shapefile data. It is also capable of producing high-quality plots.

This tutorial includes `NCL` installation steps with `conda package manager`. If you have not previously installed Anaconda on your system, you can do so by following the previous [tutorial](https://yonsci.github.io/yon_academic//portfolio/portfolio-2/).

To install NCL, launch ubuntu terminal and type the following commands:  

First create NCL environment:
<textarea style="border: none;background-color:orange;">
onda create --name ncl_stable  
</textarea>  
Choose y when prompted

Once the environment is created, activate it by typing:
<textarea style="border: none;background-color:orange;">
conda activate ncl_stable  
</textarea>

Install the NCL package:
<textarea style="border: none;background-color:orange;">
conda install -c conda-forge ncl
</textarea>

To update NCL environment to its latest version:
<textarea style="border: none;background-color:orange;">
conda update --all
</textarea>
choose y to approve of the udpates

To check the version:
<textarea style="border: none;background-color:orange;">
ncl -V
</textarea>

You have now successfully installed `NCL`. To exit from `ncl_stable` environment, simply type:  
<textarea style="border: none;background-color:orange;">
conda deactivate
</textarea>
