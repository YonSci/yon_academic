If you are working in fields which requires managing large amount of scientific data, enormous computing capacity, and  complex computing procedures,
it defiantly wiser to look for appropriate platform which has such functionalities. In my opinion, in recent years the rapid development of open source community 
give us an alternatives to look for more efficient platforms in terms of computing power, performance, security. 
In this blog , i want talk about the befits of Linux operating system (OS) for computationally intensive fields like climate modeling. 
Among it's several advantages, it makes easy modifying, customization, and configuration procedures of models. 
It also gives control over the workflows. As a result, i personally switched from Windows to Linux couple of years ago and i want to share some of the 
lesson I learned along the way. I personally advice you to move to Linux if you need these functionalities in your work. However, I must admit that majority of 
the scientific community still relies on commercial OS and packages. We call it Metathesiophobia. 

Recently, we know that Windows-10 provide a lightweight tool called Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) which allow users to run different Linux distros 
such as Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Mint etc on Windows-10. The WSL don't require virtualization and much memory which makes it super usefll. Thus, this tool 
allow users to explore the befits different Linux distros alongside Windows without the need for virtual machine and loosing their beloved Windows OS. 
As an example, here I present:
